 * Resolves collisions using impulse-based physics:
 * 1. Positional correction: Separate penetrating bodies
 * 2. Velocity resolution: Apply impulses to bounce bodies apart
 *
 * The impulse calculation considers:
 * - Relative velocity at contact point
 * - Masses of both bodies (heavier = less affected)
 * - Restitution (bounciness)
 * - Friction (tangential resistance)
 *
 * All methods are static - no instance needed.

     * Algorithm:
     * - Calculate total inverse mass: sum = 1/mA + 1/mB

     * Note: This is a simplified version. More advanced engines use
     * iterative constraint solving for better stability.

     * @param manifold Collision information
     *
     * Calculates and applies impulse to make bodies bounce apart.
     * Uses restitution and mass to determine bounce strength.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Calculate relative velocity: vrel = vA - vB
     * 2. Calculate velocity along normal: vn = vrel Â· n
     * 3. If separating (vn >= 0), no impulse needed
     * 4. Calculate impulse magnitude: j = -(1 + e) * vn / (1/mA + 1/mB)
     * 5. Apply impulse: vA += j*n/mA, vB -= j*n/mB
     *
     * Where:
     * - e = restitution (average of both bodies)
     * - n = collision normal
     * - vn = velocity along normal
     * - j = impulse magnitude
     *
     * Physical meaning:
     * - j > 0: Bodies colliding, apply bounce
     * - j = 0: Bodies sliding along surface
     * - j < 0: Bodies separating (no impulse)
     *
     * Restitution effects:
     * - e = 0: Perfectly inelastic (no bounce)
     * - e = 0.5: Moderate bounce
     * - e = 1: Perfectly elastic (full bounce)
